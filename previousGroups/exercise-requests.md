# Consuming API exercises

## Exercise 1
Call the JSON placeholder API and get all the comments. Print the name of the comment and the email address.
If a call was not successful, print an error message.

## Exercise 2
Find a nice open API that doesn't require a key. Call the API using Python and process the result (example in `joke_api.py`)
